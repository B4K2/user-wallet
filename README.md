A comprehensive RESTful API for a simple user wallet system, built with a modern Python stack. This project allows for user management, wallet balance updates, and transaction history retrieval. It is fully containerized with Docker and deployed on an AWS EC2 instance with an automated CI/CD pipeline.

## üîÑ Deployment & CI/CD

This project is configured with a complete Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using **GitHub Actions**.

1.  **Trigger:** A `git push` to the `main` branch.
2.  **Action:** The GitHub Actions workflow automatically connects to the AWS EC2 instance via SSH.
3.  **Deployment:** The script on the server then performs the following:
    *   Pulls the latest code from the `main` branch.
    *   Installs any new dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
    *   Restarts the `Gunicorn` application service to apply the changes.

This ensures that the live application is always up-to-date with the latest version of the code.
